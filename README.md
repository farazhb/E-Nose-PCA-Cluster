## E-Nose-PCA-Cluster

An analysis of odor signal segmentation using various means of clustering and the review of comparing the results of the different methods.

The data is obtained from experiments of an electronic nose device's current-voltage measurements when exposed to various types of gases/odors.

### Dev history:

Clustering and presenting the reduced dimensional view of responses to an electronic nose exposed to various edible substances

- 2016-12-25  Reorginized variables and added to references
- 2016-12-18  Made corrections to and completed the project and its report. Removed redundant variables and cells and cleaned style.
- 2016-12-14  Optimized parameters for all clustering methods, rearranged plots in figures, and cleaned up. All ready except report composition. Wrote the report.
- 2016-12-13  Added clustering methods {Affinity propagation, Mean-shift, and DBSCAN} and ptimized their parameters; plot funct improv
- 2016-12-12  Made to plot functions and aesthetics of plots and organization and removed the redundant Milks2 database from analysis
- 2016-12-5   Small correction to js cell togle hiding-showing input code
- 2016-12-4   Added K-Means clustering, it's K finding, and plots comparing with known sample ids. Cleaned up plots aesthetics tweaked plot function. Started writing report
- 2016-12-3   Placed project on GitHub repository
- 2016-11-30  Began applying PCA to the data
- 2016-11-7   Began project, reading databse into dataframes and cleaning up the data
